# Symbio-Game
16 year old student making a game (grade 11). 
Coding this using Java + Eclipse. 
Metroidvania Game about a small robot who was injected into a sick person to fight with the illnesses they are suffering with. 
The plan is mostly that the robot (the player) will travel through many different organs of the sick person and fight and platform their way through it, and hopefully heal the patient. 

Current plan (subject to change):\n
Areas:
  
    Skin (entrance)
    Stomach (zone 2)
    Intestines (zone 3)
    Bladder / Lungs (interchangeable order for zone 4/5)
    Heart (zone 6)
    Brain (zone 7, final zone)
    
    Optional Areas:
      Muscles
      Bones
      Eyes
      Ears

Controls & Abilities:

    Celeste style dash (google 'celeste game')
    Jump (normal video game jump)
    Wall jump (You can jump off & climb walls)
    Slash / Sword Swing ability (has parkour elements to it)

Graphics & Logic:

    Collisions are rectangle AABB colliders
    Game runs @ 60 fps, so player's position and state is updated 60 times per second
    Game rendered 60 times per second
    Art is pixel art style
    Animations & art are completely place holder for now
    No sound implemented yet
    Title screen & other basic game needs are not met yet (sorry)

There is a Level Editor to create levels for the Game

Software / Hardware specs:

    using pure Java code to create this, in Eclipse IDE
    using a MacBook air for this, so its not crazy hard to run on any devices (i think?)
