This is a short edit, basically consisting entirely of an animation revamp for the player, as well as enemies and also the acid game object

Animations received a new load method (notably now they are expressed as a long strip of sprites, and one image file can only contain one animation
rather than the numerous it could before. this significantly reduced the code load, and made it easier to manage different animations.

playing the animation now has a new play() method with the following parameters:
  - boolean play_pos --> to draw the animation in the following Vector2 loc, or to draw it at it's assigned position (which can btw follow an object
    because of hidden java pointers (at least that's how I imagine it long story short it works)
  - Vector2 loc --> position where to draw animation if play_pos is true, if play_pos is false this is usually put as Vector2.zero;
  - boolean flipv --> boolean as to whether the animation should flip the sprite (no need for 2 animations for both directions of movement)
  - standard drawing code: Graphics g, JPanel pane, double xin, double yin, String location, which is universal to all drawing methods (most at least)

Acid recieved animation revamp to utilise the power of this new animation method, and improve performance (can handle up to ~10000 particles as far as I know)

Scuttler enemy received new animation (temporary for know because it looks ugly)

player animations have been re-implemented (same animations as before, just improved structure & functionality for easier access to stuff)
